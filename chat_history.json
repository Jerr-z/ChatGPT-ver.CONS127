It is calculated by taking the difference between near infrared reflectance and visible red reflectance, and then dividing that by the sum of near infrared reflectance and visible red reflectance. Before a fire, NDVI values are typically high, and after a fire, NDVI values are typically low. Over time, NDVI values will increase as vegetation recovers. Landsat is particularly useful for mapping abrupt changes in vegetation health, such as forest harvest, forest fire, and conversion of areas to agricultural regions, due to its high resolution of 30 meter pixels. This can be seen in the map of forest loss and gain across the world, where red indicates forest loss, blue indicates forest gain, and green indicates forest extent."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the most primitive (i.e. the oldest) form of ocean navigation that we discussed in class?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nThe most primitive form of ocean navigation discussed in class is pilotage.

When leaves are drier, there is less water to absorb the energy, resulting in a higher reflectance.
