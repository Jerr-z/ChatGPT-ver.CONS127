[{"role": "user", "content": "what is ndvi value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n\nThe NDVI value is a metric that summarizes vegetation health. It is calculated by taking the difference between near infrared reflectance and visible red reflectance, and then dividing that by the sum of near infrared reflectance and visible red reflectance. Before a fire, NDVI values are typically high, and after a fire, NDVI values are typically low. Over time, NDVI values will increase as vegetation recovers. Landsat is particularly useful for mapping abrupt changes in vegetation health, such as forest harvest, forest fire, and conversion of areas to agricultural regions, due to its high resolution of 30 meter pixels. This can be seen in the map of forest loss and gain across the world, where red indicates forest loss, blue indicates forest gain, and green indicates forest extent."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the most primitive (i.e. the oldest) form of ocean navigation that we discussed in class?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nThe most primitive form of ocean navigation discussed in class is pilotage. Pilotage is a form of navigation that is based on visual triangulation to known landmarks and does not require an accurate position. It was used before the 15th century and is still used in coastal navigation today."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do we define the beginning of space?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nWe define the beginning of space as the transition between the atmosphere and space, which occurs at about 400 to 500 kilometers above the surface of the Earth. This is known as the Carmen line, an imaginary boundary recognized by the Federation Aeronautique International. At this altitude, air pressure approaches a vacuum, meaning there are very few air molecules and it is considered to be a space. This is the point where the gravitational pull of the Earth is no longer strong enough to keep objects in orbit, and they will begin to fall towards the Earth unless acted upon by other forces."}]
